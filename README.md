# CreateColonies
A compatibility project between Create and Structurize/Minecolonies

## Ideas for the future
- Compatibility between both request systems:
  - Some way to request items from Create via the postbox automatically? To let citizens craft things on Create's (stockkeeper's) demand?
  - Interoperability between the resource scroll and Create's clipboard?
- Some way to convert a Create schematic into a Structurize blueprint, or the other way around??? Is there a way that is not a command?
- Style
